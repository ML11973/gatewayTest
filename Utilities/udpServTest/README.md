# UDP Server Test

This small program is a basic UDP server test.

It allows testing a host's connectivity.
This is useful in situations where UDP frames cannot be read by an application and one wants to find out if it is due to a firewall, wrong configuration, addressing problems or anything else.

If this program works, chances are the problem is in the other application.

If it doesn't, time to check firewall configurations, routing settings and general connectivity.
