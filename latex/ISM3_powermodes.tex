The radio module used in this application (ISM3) has several power modes for the user to choose from. The following descriptions should help the user choose the relevant mode for their application.

Note\+: ISM stands for \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISM_radio_band}{\texttt{ Industrial-\/\+Scientific-\/\+Medical}}, which refers to the common name given to its operating band. The ISM 868 band is an unlicensed (meaning anyone can use it as long as they follow some common rules) band with center frequency at 868 MHz. There are other ISM bands, such as the 2.\+4 and 5 GHz bands used by Wi-\/\+Fi.\hypertarget{ISM3_powermodes_autotoc_md51}{}\doxysubsubsection{ISM\+\_\+\+TX}\label{ISM3_powermodes_autotoc_md51}
Module is in gateway mode. It will be the master of its WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network).\hypertarget{ISM3_powermodes_autotoc_md52}{}\doxysubsubsection{SM\+\_\+\+RX\+\_\+\+ACTIVE}\label{ISM3_powermodes_autotoc_md52}
Module is in RX mode. It will remain in SYNCHRONIZED state all the time, and receive unicast and multicast frames. The module will not enter power saving mode.\hypertarget{ISM3_powermodes_autotoc_md53}{}\doxysubsubsection{SM\+\_\+\+RX\+\_\+\+LOW\+\_\+\+POWER}\label{ISM3_powermodes_autotoc_md53}
Module is in low power mode. It will not react to group wakeups and remain asleep. The only way for the module to receive data is to get it from a beacon data change.\hypertarget{ISM3_powermodes_autotoc_md54}{}\doxysubsubsection{SM\+\_\+\+RX\+\_\+\+LOW\+\_\+\+POWER\+\_\+\+GROUP}\label{ISM3_powermodes_autotoc_md54}
Module is in low power mode and will react to group wakeups. When the gateway wakes one of the groups the module belongs to, it will enter state ISM\+\_\+\+SYNCHRONIZED. When the node is synchronized, it will receive unicast and multicast frames.
