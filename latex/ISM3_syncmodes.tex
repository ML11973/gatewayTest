The ISM module used in has several sync modes for the user to choose from. The following descriptions should help the user choose the relevant mode for their application.\hypertarget{ISM3_syncmodes_autotoc_md52}{}\doxysubsubsection{ISM\+\_\+\+TX}\label{ISM3_syncmodes_autotoc_md52}
Module is in gateway mode. It will be the master of its WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Network).\hypertarget{ISM3_syncmodes_autotoc_md53}{}\doxysubsubsection{SM\+\_\+\+RX\+\_\+\+ACTIVE}\label{ISM3_syncmodes_autotoc_md53}
Module is in RX mode. It will remain in SYNCHRONIZED state all the time, and receive unicast and multicast frames. The module will not enter power saving mode.\hypertarget{ISM3_syncmodes_autotoc_md54}{}\doxysubsubsection{SM\+\_\+\+RX\+\_\+\+LOW\+\_\+\+POWER}\label{ISM3_syncmodes_autotoc_md54}
Module is in low power mode. It will not react to group wakeups and remain asleep. The only way for the module to receive data is to get it from a beacon data change.\hypertarget{ISM3_syncmodes_autotoc_md55}{}\doxysubsubsection{SM\+\_\+\+RX\+\_\+\+LOW\+\_\+\+POWER\+\_\+\+GROUP}\label{ISM3_syncmodes_autotoc_md55}
Module is in low power mode and will react to group wakeups. When the gateway wakes one of the groups the module belongs to, it will enter state ISM\+\_\+\+SYNCHRONIZED. When the node is synchronized, it will receive unicast and multicast frames.
