This software was originally developped to be run on a Raspberry Pi CM4 supplemented by a custom ISM 868 MHz radio module (from here on referred to as \char`\"{}shield\char`\"{}). \tabulinesep=1mm

The Pi CM4 lies on a custom breakout board developped for IoT applications. The shield is a breakout board for a custom radio module. This arrangement allows the CM4 to communicate with the shield via serial peripheral /dev/tty\+AMA1, as defined in \mbox{\hyperlink{hardware_8h}{hardware.\+h}}.
