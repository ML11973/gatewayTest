Welcome to the WPAN gateway documentation! This software was built as part of a 2023 HES-\/\+SO MSc thesis at HEIG-\/\+VD\textquotesingle{}s Re\+DS institute.

The goal of this software is to provide a way to access WPAN nodes remotely.

The original use case is regulation of a household\textquotesingle{}s power consumption. It is supposed that the household has autonomous power production capacities like solar panels as well as access to the electrical power grid. This software provides a way to interface with various WPAN nodes to control their power production or consumption. A more specific use case is to minimize a household\textquotesingle{}s power consumption from the grid. This can be achieved by filling power storage (electric car, water heater, backup battery) when the household has surplus self-\/generated power (solar, wind). For this to work, nodes must monitor household power production, consumption and net grid consumption. A server has to retrieve this data and control power consumers accordingly.

A second use case is to route some internet traffic to a remote low-\/speed network using the extended range WPAN provides, instead of routing an Ethernet cable.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md0}{}\doxysection{Feature backlog}\label{index_autotoc_md0}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item WPAN manager initialization with path to config file
\item Allow static node update during execution by parsing config file
\item Add power and power in d\+Bm to options in config file
\item Change Node type management from several typed lists to one dynamically allocated pointer vector
\item Add source port/address to DATA frames for reliable response addresses or check frame ID to determine this
\item ISM3\+\_\+\+Linux driver with hardware reset (needs new version of shield)
\item Add universal Node subclass that handles all protocols. To be done once Node type management has been changed to a single dynamically allocated pointer vector.
