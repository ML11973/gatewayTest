General information\+: It takes approximately 15 seconds for a node to lose sync with the current configuration in \mbox{\hyperlink{ism3_8c}{ism3.\+c}}. This is because the node tries several times to reach the gateway until it determines it has lost sync.\hypertarget{ISM3_states_autotoc_md55}{}\doxysubsubsection{ISM\+\_\+\+OFF}\label{ISM3_states_autotoc_md55}
Module is uninitialized.\hypertarget{ISM3_states_autotoc_md56}{}\doxysubsubsection{ISM\+\_\+\+NOT\+\_\+\+SYNCHRONIZED}\label{ISM3_states_autotoc_md56}
Module is waiting for sync. It is not connected to a gateway.\hypertarget{ISM3_states_autotoc_md57}{}\doxysubsubsection{ISM\+\_\+\+SYNCHRONIZED}\label{ISM3_states_autotoc_md57}
Module is synchronized to a gateway. Gets in this state on wakeup from gateway if it is in SM\+\_\+\+RX\+\_\+\+LOW\+\_\+\+POWER\+\_\+\+GROUP power mode. Stays in this state for as long as it is connected in SM\+\_\+\+RX\+\_\+\+ACTIVE power mode.\hypertarget{ISM3_states_autotoc_md58}{}\doxysubsubsection{ISM\+\_\+\+LOW\+\_\+\+POWER\+\_\+\+SYNC}\label{ISM3_states_autotoc_md58}
Module is synced to a gateway in SM\+\_\+\+LOW\+\_\+\+POWER or SM\+\_\+\+LOW\+\_\+\+POWER\+\_\+\+GROUP power mode, but not woken up. Cannot be woken up in SM\+\_\+\+LOW\+\_\+\+POWER.\hypertarget{ISM3_states_autotoc_md59}{}\doxysubsubsection{ISM\+\_\+\+TX\+\_\+\+SYNC}\label{ISM3_states_autotoc_md59}
Module is the gateway of its WPAN.\hypertarget{ISM3_states_autotoc_md60}{}\doxysubsubsection{ISM\+\_\+\+VERSION\+\_\+\+READY}\label{ISM3_states_autotoc_md60}
Module is getting initialized and has not received a power mode.
